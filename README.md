# CS 4412 - Data Mining Project Proposal

## Brief Description:
The Student Performance dataset contains
demographic, academic, social, and lifestyle information
about secondary school students enrolled in two distinct
subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language. The data
was collected from two Portuguese schools and captures
a wide range of factors including family background,
study habits, school engagement, alcohol consumption, and
academic outcomes. Academic performance is represented
through three grade attributes rather than a single target label,
making the dataset suitable for exploratory pattern discovery
